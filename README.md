# This is my first project for my Stats220 course at UOA learning markdown
My goals with this course:
1. learn how to program in R
2. use R to create web pages
3. Utilise modern technologies like HTML and CSS to make better web pages

*Note: I put "stats220" as the R project within the "Project 1" folder for this, instead of using "Project 1" as the R project*
